# Bazel will stop building after encountering the first error.
# This flag tells Bazel build as much as possible and show as many build errors as possible.
# https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#keep-going
#build --keep_going

# Tells Bazel to use host OS specific configues.
# This is the equivalent to using --config=linux on Linux, --config=windows on Windows, and 
# --config=macos on Apple.

# || Test ||
# ==========
# By default, Bazel hides test output in log files that you have to manually find and open.
# This prints a combined stdout/stderr output from tests immediately after the test is completed, 
# ensuring that test output from simultaneous tests are not interleaved with each other.
# https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#test-output
test --test_output=all

# Always download coverage files for tests from the remote cache.
# This allows for full coverage reports to be generated on the CI without needing to run all tests.

# Bazel will attempt to generate a toolchain configuration if you dont register one

# and we want to be sure that Bazel isnt silently falling back to the system toolchain.
# this option disables the automatic toolchain configuration and errors out the build
# if for some reason the hermetic toolchain breaks

# || Remote Caching ||
# ====================
# Remote caching in Bazel:
# * reduces build times by reusing build artifacts from previous builds, and
# * reduces test times by only running tests that have been impacted by changes.
# Cortecs configures remote the remote cache to be publically readable but only written by the merge queue.
# While much of this is in the spirit of SLSA hardened builds, publishing provenance is TODO.
# This allows local builds to use the cache but not pollute it with local artifacts.

# Google cloud buckets have out of the box support for Bazel remote caching.
# https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--remote_cache
common --remote_cache=https://storage.googleapis.com/cortecs-build-cache

# Bazel includes the value of PATH as part of the key for remote cache lookups.
# Different values of PATH between different systems (ie. CI and local) will cause cache misses.
# This forces Bazel to use a static value for PATH, and it will not inheret LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

# Debugging hints:
# https://bazel.build/remote/cache-remote#troubleshooting-cache-hits
# 1) clear the remote cache
# 2) run with `--execution_log_compact_file` on both CI and local build
#   2.1) CI is configured to upload the log as an artifact and can be downloaded from the workflow run
#   2.2) https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--execution_log_compact_file
# 3) use `bazel-bin/src/tools/execlog/parser` to generate a sorted, human readable log
#   3.1) https://bazel.build/remote/cache-remote#compare-logs
#   3.2) https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/src/tools/execlog
# 4) Compare in vscode with right click `select for compare` then right click the other `compare with selected`
# 5) Look through the diff to figure out what might be causing cache lookup between the two environments to differ.
