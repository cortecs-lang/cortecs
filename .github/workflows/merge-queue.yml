name: Checks run in merge queue

# Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76655935/when-does-a-github-workflow-trigger-for-merge-group-and-is-it-restricted-by-bran
# Particularly the answer by @kojoru

# when adding new checks:
# 1. Add the new job to both merge-queue.yml and pull-request.yml
#   1.1. The job name should be the same in both files
#   1.2. It needs to exist in both files, so even if it's a large test that we dont want to
#        run on every PR event, still add it to pull-request.yml but make it a no-op job.
# 2. Add the new job to required status checks
#   2.1. Go to Settings -> Rules -> Rulesets -> Merge Queue -> Require status checks to pass
#   2.2. + Add checks
#   2.3. add the new job name: the id that comes under jobs
#     2.3.1. it might not show up as a github action. it might just show up as "Any source"
#     2.3.2. adding a name parameter to the job seems to mess this up.
#            too lazy to figure out why, so just leave it out.
